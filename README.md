Development of a new type of thermal micro driver 
Recently, a combination of fabrication methods has enabled the design of multilayer microwires consisting of a Pyrex-coated amorphous metallic core, an intermediate sputtered noble metal, and an external layer. Particularly, the presence of the external layer has been proved to induce significant mechanical stresses in the amorphous core that originate very relevant modifications of its mechanic properties. Heating of multilayer microwire (MM) during flow of electric current induces additional mechanical stresses. In frame of this project a new type of thermal micro driver working on the principle of the thermo-elastic deformation of MM has been designed and developed.  
Technical description of the thermal micro driver
Similar to the magnetic micro driver, the thermal micro driver is a chip (0.5x1.5 cm) with embedded MM.  The ends of MM are soldered into the chip, which assured fixed position of the ends. The distance between fixation points is shorter than the length of MM. This connection assures arc shape of MM. Application of direct current along the MM induces thermo-elastic deformation of the arc shaped MM. The micro motion is created at the top of the arc, in a direction perpendicular to MM‚Äôs axis. The radius of amorphous metallic core was 7.5 ¬µm, the thickness of Pyrex glass coat was 1.4 ¬µm, the thickness of sputtered noble metal microlayer was 0.33 ¬µm, the thickness of external layer was 2.9 ¬µm and the length of MM was 1 cm.
Design of a motion control system 
The thermal micro driver was tested by a motion control system. The aim of the testing was to find the values of the direct current in which the micro driver is active and to find the dependence of the bending amplitude of the MM on the direct current. The motion control system included a programmable power supply and a microscope with a camera. Before starting the test, the thermal micro driver is connected to the programmed power supply.  During the test, the direct current varies according to the program. The position of the central part of the MM in the shape of the arc is monitored. Tests have shown that the dependence of the bending amplitude (0-9 ¬µm) on the direct current in the range 20-35 mA is linear.

Software for simulation of the thermal micro driver
The direct current flowing along the MM induces Joule's heat and magnetic field. Elastic deformation of MM is caused by two phenomena: thermo-elastic (TE) deformation as a result of Joule's heat and magneto-elastic (ME) deformation as a result of induced magnetic field.
TE deformation
TE deformation of MM is simulated using a planar layer model where the chemical composition of the planar layers is the same as the chemical composition of the individual layers of MM and the thickness hi of each planar layer is twice the standard thickness deviation of the corresponding layer in MM (Fig 1a). The planar layers represent the axial asymmetry of MM. The TE deformation of system of plane layers can be then expressed as bending amplitude A1 (Fig 1b) as a function of temperature change ‚àÜT
	1/P=(6‚àë_i^n‚ñí„ÄñE_i h_i (Œ±_i-Œ±_s ) „Äó ‚àÜT)/(E_s h_s^2 )	(3.1)


P is the curvature radius 
	P^2=„Äñ(P-A1)„Äó^2+ „Äñ(l/2)„Äó^2	(3.2)

l is its length of plane layers‚Äô system. ES and Œ±S denote Young‚Äôs modules and thermal expansion coefficients of amorphous metal layer. Ei and Œ±i (i=1, 2, 3) denote Young‚Äôs modules and thermal expansion coefficients of Pyrex glass, noble metal and external layer, respectively. hs is thickness of amorphous metal layer. 
 


Temperature changes of individual layers
	‚àÜT_i=  (4q_i l^2)/(K_i œÄ^3 ) {-exp[-Œ∫_i (œÄ/l)^2 t]}	(3.3)

where qi=Ii2/(Si2œÉi). Si, Ii, and œÉi are cross section, electric current, and electrical conductivity of i-th layer, respectively. Œ∫i=Ki/(Dici) where Ki, Di, and ci are heat conductivity, mass density, and specific heat capacity of the i-th layer, respectively. l is the length of i-th. t is a time interval at constant current. Electrical current, I, flows through three metallic layers. The values of direct currents flowing through amorphous metal layer, noble metal layer, and external layer was determined from Kirchhoff‚Äôs First and Second laws. The temperature change of plane layer system is calculated as a mean value of temperature changes in individual layers.
ME deformation
Magnetic field induced by direct current causes magnetostriction expansion of MM. If both ends are fixed, the bending is caused by the length change of MM. Actually, the resultant magnetic field is induced by the currents flowing through the three metallic layers; amorphous metallic core, an intermediate sputtered noble metal, and an external layer. Magnetic field induced by the direct current I in amorphous metallic core is calculated in two steps. In the first step, magnetic field, B1, generated inside the metallic core was determined from modified Biot-Savart law
	B_1=  (Œº_0 Ix)/(2œÄR^2 )	(3.4)
where ¬µ0 is vacuum permeability, R is radius of metallic core, and x is a radial distance from the MM‚Äôs axis in range 0-r1 where r1 is the radius of metallic core. As the second step, magnetic field outside the metallic core was determined form the Biot-Savart law for long straight wire 
	B_2=  (Œº_0 I)/2œÄx	(3.5)

Magnetic fields induced by the direct current in next layers is determined in the same way. The bending amplitude A2 is determined from relation
	L= (A2+ l^2/(4*A2))arcsin(l/(A2+ l^2/(4*A2)))	(3.6)

where L = ùõøl + l is the length of MM after magnetostrictive expansion and ùõøl is the length change of MM, calculated as a product of the mean value of magnetostriction, ùúÜmean, and the initial length of MM. A mean value of magnetostriction is determined from individual values of magnetostriction along the MM‚Äôs radius. The values of direct current corresponds to temperature changes calculated in TE deformation.
Contribution of TE and ME deformation to resultant deformation of MM
The contribution of TE deformation to the deformation of MM is more than 20 times larger than the deformation related with magnetostrictive effect. Both contributions were included to the bending amplitude A as a function of ‚àÜT. Calculated results and experimentally determined results are shown in Figure 2.
